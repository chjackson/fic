* Check results vector includes everything useful, check formulae 

* Testing against well understood examples, e.g. in book

* More model classes

	- survival 
	- illustrate for problems other than covariate selection, e.g. flexible survival models with shape parameter = 1
	- ???

* Analytic derivatives for particular focuses

  - interface for this implemented, needs a few more examples and testing
  
  - expected value in normal linear regression

* Interface for comparing multiple models, e.g. all combinations

  - with some graphics 
  - inds argument as a matrix

* Illustrate averaged/weighted FIC

* Cox models (needs additional theory?)

* Model averaging weights

* Error handling for all functions

* Vignette + paper
