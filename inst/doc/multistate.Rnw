\title{Examples of focused model comparison: multi-state models}
\Plainauthor{Christopher Jackson, MRC Biostatistics Unit}

\Abstract{
  This vignette illustrates focused model comparison with the
  \pkg{fic} package for covariate selection in multi-state models
  fitted with the \pkg{msm} package.  A challenge of this
  example is that a single model involves several regression models
  fitted simultaneously, so that the set of parameters has a
  non-standard structure.  Additionally, the focus is a complicated
  function of the model parameters.

\section{Multi-state models for panel data}

The \pkg{msm} package \citep{msmjss} fits continuous-time Markov
multi-state models to ``panel-observed'' longitudinal data. 
That is, data in which a categorical
outcome, or \emph{state}, is observed at a series of times for a set of
individuals.   A typical application is to states of disease recorded 
at clinic visits.   The actual times of transition between states are not
observed, and we only know the state of the process at the visit
times.  The likelihood for this class of models was orginally
described by \citet{kalbfleisch:lawless}. 

The example dataset \code{psor} in the package records the progression
of joint damage for 305 patients with psoriatic arthritis \citep[from][]{gladman1999progression}
Each of the 806 rows represents a clinic visit.  The outcome is the variable
\code{state}, where 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent 0, 1--4, 5--9 and 10 or
more damaged joints, respectively. 

A four-state continuous-time Markov model is fitted with the structure
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:states}, where the (unobserved) instantaneous transitions in continuous
time are assumed to only occur between adjacent states, from state 1
to state 2, from state 2 to state 3, and from state 3 to state 4. 
There are two binary covariates, \code{hieffusn} (presence of five or more
effusions) and \code{ollwsdrt} (low erythrocyte sedimentation rate), 
that are assumed to affect the intensity parameters governing all
three of the transitions.  The covariates are constant through time
and measured at baseline.   The transition intensity from state $r$ to
state $s$ for person $i$ with covariates $\x_i$ is then 

\[ q_{irs}(x) = q_{rs}^{(0)} \exp(\bbeta_{rs}\x_{i}) \] 

where $\bbeta_{rs} = (\beta_{rs}^{(1)},\beta_{rs}^{(2)})$ is the vector of log hazard ratios on the $r$--$s$ transition for the two covariates.

To fit the model in \pkg{msm}, a matrix \code{Qind} is defined that
indicates which instantaneous transitions are permitted, from the
state indicated in the rows to the state indicated in the columns.
The \code{msm} function fits the model with the given covariates,
which by default affect all transitions. 

<<>>=
if (!require("msm"))
    stop("The `msm` package should be installed
to run code in this vignette") 
Qind <- rbind(c(0, 1, 0, 0),
              c(0, 0, 1, 0),
              c(0, 0, 0, 1),
              c(0, 0, 0, 0))
psor.wide.msm <- msm(state ~ months, subject=ptnum, data=psor, 
                     qmatrix = Qind,  gen.inits=TRUE,
                     covariates = ~ollwsdrt+hieffusn)

The hazard ratios $exp(\bbeta_{rs})$ for the two covariates are
presented in the model output. The confidence intervals are wide,
which suggests that a smaller model might give more precise
estimates. 

\section{Focused comparison of multi-state models fitted with ``msm''}

Focused model comparison is performed to assess whether removing the
covariate effects for particular transitions lead to more precise
estimates of a focus quantity, defined below. 
The unusual feature of this example, compared to a standard
covariate selection problem, is that the model involves three regressions 
fitted simultaneously, one for each transition. 

We compare the wide model and six further submodels with covariates on
different transitions, as defined in the table below.  Model 7 is
the wide model where both covariates affect all transitions, 
and models 1--6 are defined by fixing particular
$\beta_{rs}$ to 0 in the wide model. 

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline  
Model  & \code{ollwsdrt} & \code{hieffusn}\\
& \multicolumn{2}{l}{affects transition from state:} \\
\hline 
1& none & none \\
2& none & 3 \\
3& none & 2,3 \\ 
4& none & 1,2,3 \\
5& 3 & 1,2,3\\
6& 2,3 & 1,2,3\\
7& 1,2,3 & 1,2,3\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \caption{Specification of multi-state regression models being compared}
  \label{tab:models}
\end{table}

The seven models correspond to the rows of the following indicator
matrix that can be supplied to \code{fic} to compare the models.    
The columns indicate the parameters, in the order $(q_{12}^{(0)}, q_{23}^{(0)},q_{34}^{(0)},\beta_{12}^{(1)},\beta_{23}^{(1)},\beta_{34}^{(1)},\beta_{12}^{(2)},\beta_{23}^{(2)},\beta_{34}^{(2)})$.  This is the order understood by the
\code{updatepars.msm} function below in the \pkg{msm} package, which
we will need to define the focus function.

<<>>=
inds <- rbind(
    c(1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0),
    c(1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1),
    c(1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1),
    c(1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1),
    c(1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1),
    c(1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1),
    c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
)
@ 

The focus function in this example is taken as the expected total time spent in state 4 over 10 years for people currently in state 1 without \code{ollwsdrt} or \code{hieffusn}.   This is defined as 

\[ 
\int_{0}^{10} p_{14}(t|\x = 0)
\]

where $p_{rs}(t|\x)$ is the probability of being in state $s$ at time
$t$ for a person in state $r$ at time 0 with covariates $\x$. 
This is the $r,s$ entry of the \emph{transition probability matrix} $P(t|\x)$, defined for a time-homogeneous continuous-time Markov model with intensity matrix $Q(\x)$ as the matrix exponential of $tQ(\x)$. 

The \pkg{msm} package has the function \code{totlos.msm} to calculate
the expected total time in each state, for a given model, covariate values and time
interval. For the wide model, in this example, this is

<<>>=
totlos.msm(psor.wide.msm, covariates=0, tot=10)
@ 

However, for \code{fic}, the focus needs to be defined as a function of the
\emph{vector of parameters} \code{pars} that define $Q(\x)$, rather than a function of the \emph{fitted
  model object}.   To accomplish this, \pkg{msm} provides the function
\code{updatepars.msm}.  This alters a fitted model object (supplied in its
first argument) by changing the point estimates to the values supplied 
in the second argument.   This allows the focus function for
\code{fic} to be defined as 

<<>>=
focus_tlos <- function(pars){
    x.new <- updatepars.msm(psor.wide.msm, pars)
    totlos.msm(x.new, covariates=0, tot=10)["State 4"]
}
@

The same technique can be used for various other multi-state model
outputs in \pkg{msm} which are complex functions of the
model parameters. 

Note that \code{updatepars.msm} is only available in \pkg{msm} version 1.6.6 or
later, available from CRAN since 3 Feb 2017.   

Finally, the focused model comparison is performed. 

<<>>=
library(fic)
fic(wide=psor.wide.msm, inds=inds, focus=focus_tlos)
@ 

The estimated biases in the focus (estimated as 0.64 years under the
wide model, see the output from \code{totlos.msm} above) range from 0
to -0.1.  The standard error of the focus increases as covariates are added to the
model. 

Compare models 4, 5, 6 and 7, which include \code{hieffusn} for all
transitions.   The bias and MSE for model 5
are worse than that for models 6 and 7, since the association
of \code{ollwsdrt} with transition 2 was omitted from model 5.
Further omitting the effect of \code{ollwsdrt} for transition 1 does
not increase the estimated bias, since the association is not strong
for this transition.
 
However models 1-3, where \code{ollwsdrt} is removed from the model
altogether, have lower MSEs than models 4-7 that include
\code{ollwsdrt}.  The biases in the focus estimate from
omitting this covariate are estimated to be negligible for models 2
and 3.   Model 2, which includes the potentially-large effect of
\code{ollwsdrt} on the third transition, has the lowest MSE.
