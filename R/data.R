#' @format A data frame with 189 rows and 19 variables.  The first 10 columns are included in the dataset of the same name in the \pkg{MASS} package.  The remaining 9 columns are defined in Claeskens and Hjort (2008), and are included in this dataset for convenience.

#' Malignant melanoma survival data
#'
#' Data originally analysed by Andersen et al (1993) on the survival of 205 patients in Denmark with malignant melanoma, and used by Claeskens and Hjort (2008) to illustrate focused model selection in Cox regression.
