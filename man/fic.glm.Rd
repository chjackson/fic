\usage{
\method{fic}{glm}(wide, inds, inds0, focus = NULL, focus_deriv = NULL,
  X = NULL, sub = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{wide}{Fitted model object containing the wide model.}

\item{inds}{matrix or vector of indicators for which parameters are included in the submodel or submodels.

A matrix should be supplied if multiple submodels are to be assessed.  This should have number of rows equal to the number of submodels to be assessed, and number of columns equal to the total number of parameters in the wide model.  It contains 1s in the positions where the parameter is included in the submodel, and 0s in positions where the parameter is excluded.  This should always be 1 in the positions defining the narrow model, as specified in `inds0`.}

\item{inds0}{Specification of narrow model, in the same format as \code{inds}.  TODO error checking}

\item{focus}{An R function with:

\itemize{
\item first argument named \code{par}, denoting a vector of parameters

\item an optional second argument named \code{X}, typically denoting covariate values.  The required format is documented below. 
}

The function should return the focus quantity of interest.  If \code{X} is supplied and has multiple rows, then \code{focus} should return a vector giving the focus for each row of \code{X}.  Otherwise \code{focus} should return a scalar giving the focus value at \code{par}.

Not required if \code{focus_deriv} is specified.

Alternatively, \code{focus} can be a character string naming a built-in focus function supplied by the \pkg{fic} package.  See \code{\link{focus_fns}}.}

\item{focus_deriv}{Vector of partial derivatives of the focus function with respect to the parameters in the wide model.  This is not usually needed, as it can generally be computed automatically and accurately from the function supplied in \code{focus}, using numerical differentiation.}

\item{X}{Second argument of the focus function, typically giving covariate values defining the focus. This can either be a matrix or a vector.

This is optional.  If not supplied, \code{focus} should return a scalar giving the focus value at parameters \code{par}.

To compute focused model comparison statistics for the same focus function evaluated at multiple covariate values, \code{X} should be a matrix, with number of columns equal to the number of parameters in the wide model, and number of rows equal to the number of alternative covariate values.

For a typical regression model, the first parameter will denote an intercept, so the first value of \code{X} should be 1, and the remaining values should correspond to covariates whose coefficients form parameters of the wide model.  See the examples in the vignette.

If just one covariate value is needed, then \code{X} can be a vector of length equal to the number of parameters in the wide model.}

\item{sub}{List of fitted model objects for each submodel to be assessed, or alternatively, the model object for a single submodel to be assessed.  This is optional, and only required if you want the estimate of the focus function under each submodel to be included in the results.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to the focus function can be supplied here.  Currently no examples of this.}

Focused information criterion for generalized linear models fitted with glm().
This can be used to compare models with different covariates.  TODO any other model selection problems?
